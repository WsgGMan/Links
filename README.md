# Censorship

This proxies supports many sites, hoping to support hCAPTCHA. [maybe] 

# Hop.sh 

Hop.sh does not support many websites such as twitter, discord & more.

Remember if you host this on hop, it will not work on all websites. 

For ex: unblocked.hop.sh [This does not support most websites and is hosted by Intellstellar]
